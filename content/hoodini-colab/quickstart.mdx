# Quick Start

This guide walks you through running your first genomic neighborhood analysis using Hoodini Colab in Google Colab.

## Prerequisites

All you need is:
- A Google account (for Google Colab)
- A web browser
- NCBI protein or nucleotide IDs to analyze

<Callout type="info">
  No local installation required! Everything runs in the cloud.
</Callout>

## Your First Analysis

<Steps>

### Open Google Colab

Click the badge below to open the pre-configured notebook:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pentamorfico/hoodini-colab/blob/main/hoodini_colab.ipynb)

### Install the Package

Run the first cell to install hoodini-colab:

```python
!pip install -q hoodini-colab
```

This takes about 10-15 seconds.

### Launch the Widget

Run the second cell to display the interactive launcher:

```python
from hoodini_colab import create_launcher

launcher = create_launcher()
display(launcher)
```

You'll see the Hoodini Colab interface with collapsible configuration sections.

### Configure Your Input

In the **Input** section:

1. Select your input mode:
   - **Single Input** — Enter a single NCBI protein ID (e.g., `WP_012345678.1`)
   - **Input List** — Paste multiple IDs, one per line
   - **Input Sheet** — Provide a table with coordinates and assembly info

2. Enter your protein or nucleotide ID(s)

3. Set the output directory (default: `hoodini_output`)

### Choose Annotation Tools (Optional)

Expand the **Annotations** section and toggle the tools you want:

- **PADLOC** — Antiphage defense systems
- **DefenseFinder** — Defense system detection
- **CCtyper** — CRISPR-Cas systems
- **geNomad** — Mobile genetic elements
- **eggNOG** — Functional annotations

<Callout type="warning">
  Each annotation tool requires downloading its database on first use. Enable only the tools you need to minimize setup time.
</Callout>

### Run the Analysis

Click **"Run Hoodini Analysis"** at the bottom of the widget.

The widget will:
1. Install Hoodini via pixi (first run only, ~3-5 min)
2. Download required databases (first run only, ~2-5 min per tool)
3. Execute your analysis
4. Show progress in real-time

### Download Results

When complete, your results will be in the output directory. You can:

- Browse files in the Colab file panel (left sidebar)
- Download the entire folder as a ZIP
- Open the interactive HTML visualization directly

</Steps>

## Understanding the Output

After a successful run, you'll find:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hoodini_viz.html` | Interactive visualization (open in browser) |
| `neighborhoods.tsv` | Neighborhood data in tabular format |
| `proteins.faa` | Extracted protein sequences |
| `tree.nwk` | Phylogenetic tree (if tree-mode enabled) |
| `annotations/` | Results from annotation tools |

## Example: Analyzing a Defense System

Let's analyze the genomic neighborhoods around a DUF4297-containing protein:

1. In **Input Mode**, select "Single Input"
2. Enter: `WP_011712265.1`
3. Enable **PADLOC** and **DefenseFinder** in Annotations
4. Set **Tree Mode** to `taxonomy_tree`
5. Click **Run Hoodini Analysis**

This will:
- Find homologs via remote BLAST
- Extract their genomic neighborhoods
- Detect defense systems in each neighborhood
- Build a taxonomy-based tree
- Generate an interactive visualization

## Tips for Better Performance

<Callout type="info">
  **Add an NCBI API key** to increase rate limits and speed up data downloads. Get one free at [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/).
</Callout>

- **Start small**: Test with a few sequences before running large analyses
- **Limit annotation tools**: Each tool adds database download time
- **Use taxonomy trees**: Faster than AAI/ANI-based trees for large datasets
- **Reuse sessions**: Keep the Colab session open to avoid re-installing Hoodini
