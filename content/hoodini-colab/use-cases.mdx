# Use Cases

This page covers the most common analysis scenarios you can run with Hoodini Colab.

## Single Protein Analysis

When you want to explore the genomic neighborhood of a specific protein.

**Scenario**: You found an interesting protein in a paper and want to see what genes surround it across different organisms.

**Configuration**:
1. Select **Single Input** mode
2. Enter an NCBI protein ID (e.g., `WP_012345678.1`)
3. Configure Remote BLAST settings:
   - **E-value**: `1e-10` (default, adjust for stringency)
   - **Max targets**: `100` (how many homologs to retrieve)

```
Input: WP_012345678.1
Mode: Single Input
Remote BLAST E-value: 1e-10
Max targets: 100
```

<Callout type="info">
  Single Input mode uses remote BLAST to automatically find homologous sequences. This only works with NCBI protein IDs.
</Callout>

## Custom Homolog List

When you already have a curated list of sequences to compare.

**Scenario**: You ran your own BLAST search and want to analyze specific sequences rather than letting Hoodini choose.

**Configuration**:
1. Select **Input List** mode
2. Paste your IDs (one per line):

```
WP_000000001.1
WP_000000002.1
WP_000000003.1
NZ_CP000001.1
```

<Callout>
  Unlike Single Input mode, you can mix NCBI protein IDs and nucleotide IDs in this mode.
</Callout>

## Analyzing Non-Coding Regions

For CRISPR arrays, regulatory elements, or genomic islands.

**Scenario**: You want to compare CRISPR arrays or other non-coding genomic regions.

**Configuration**:
1. Select **Input List** mode
2. Enter nucleotide accessions (e.g., `NZ_CP000001.1`)
3. In **Neighborhood Window**:
   - Set appropriate window sizes for your elements
   - Consider larger windows for genomic islands

```
Input: NZ_CP000001.1, NZ_CP000002.1
Window upstream: 15000
Window downstream: 15000
```

## Defense System Survey

Comprehensive scan for antiphage defense systems.

**Scenario**: You want to catalog all defense systems in the neighborhoods around your genes of interest.

**Configuration**:
1. Set up your input (any mode)
2. Enable annotation tools:
   - ✅ **PADLOC** — Antiphage defense systems
   - ✅ **DefenseFinder** — Defense system detection
   - ✅ **CCtyper** — CRISPR-Cas systems
   - ✅ **geNomad** — Mobile genetic elements

<Callout type="warning">
  **First-time setup**: Each tool requires downloading its database. Allow extra time (~2-5 min per tool) on the first run.
</Callout>

## Phylogenetic Context Analysis

Add evolutionary context with tree construction.

**Scenario**: You want to visualize how genomic neighborhoods vary across a phylogenetic tree.

**Configuration**:
1. Set up your input
2. In **Tree Construction**, select a method:

<Tabs items={['Taxonomy Tree', 'AAI Tree', 'ANI Tree']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Fastest option** — Uses NCBI taxonomy
    ```
    Tree mode: taxonomy_tree
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Protein similarity** — Based on Average Amino Acid Identity
    ```
    Tree mode: aai_tree
    Protein links: enabled
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Nucleotide similarity** — Based on Average Nucleotide Identity
    ```
    Tree mode: ani_tree
    Nucleotide links: enabled
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom Coordinates (Input Sheet)

For precise control over which genomic regions to analyze.

**Scenario**: You have specific coordinates from your own analysis or want to reproduce exact regions.

**Configuration**:
1. Select **Input Sheet** mode
2. Fill in the table with:
   - `protein_id` or `nucleotide_id`
   - `assembly_id`
   - `start` and `end` coordinates
   - `strand` (+/-)

Example table format:

| protein_id | assembly_id | start | end | strand |
|------------|-------------|-------|-----|--------|
| WP_000001.1 | GCF_000001.1 | 10000 | 25000 | + |
| WP_000002.1 | GCF_000002.1 | 50000 | 65000 | - |

<Callout>
  You can also paste TSV data directly into the table.
</Callout>

## Comparing Gene Clusters

Visualize conserved operons across species.

**Scenario**: You're studying a biosynthetic gene cluster and want to see how it varies across organisms.

**Configuration**:
1. Use **Input List** mode with proteins from the cluster
2. Enable **Protein Links** to see sequence similarity
3. Set **Clustering** to group similar genes:
   - Identity threshold: `0.3` (30%)
   - Coverage threshold: `0.8` (80%)
4. Enable a tree method to order genomes

## Batch Processing Tips

For large-scale analyses:

- **Start with a subset**: Test with 10-20 sequences first
- **Use taxonomy trees**: Faster than AAI/ANI for large datasets
- **Limit annotations**: Each tool adds processing time
- **Add NCBI API key**: Speeds up data downloads significantly

```python
# Set API key before running
import os
os.environ['NCBI_API_KEY'] = 'your_api_key_here'
```
